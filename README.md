AngulaRank challenge
In the heart of Github portal is repository. This is good but not for non­IT people. They would like to browse people and find interesting ones. This is your challenge. Your goal is to pivot Github data in a way that users are in the center of it. To narrow our scope lets focus for the purpose of this exercise on Angular repo https://github.com/angular. You can find there many repositories and each of them has it’s own contributors.

Your goal is to create an app that will rank Angular repositories contributors and show them in one list.

The rank should be filterable by amount of contributions made by developer to all Angular repositories, by amount of followers, public repos & gists he/she published.

We should be able to view the details page of each contributor with all repositories he contributed to and his details.

We should be able to navigate to repository details page where we can find other contributors.
